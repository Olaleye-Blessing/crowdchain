## About

CrowdChain is designed to provide a decentralized and transparent platform for crowdfunding. Users can create campaigns with or without milestones. Milestones can be `Pending`, `InProgress`, `Completed`, `Approved`, `Rejected`.

For campaign without milestones, donors can request for a refund before the campaign refund deadline has passed. Campaign owner can withdraw the campaign funds once the refund deadline is over.

For campaigns with milestone, donors can request for a refund before the first milestone is approved. Milestone approval happens when the campaign owner has withdrawn the funds raised for the milestone.

Campaign owners can update their donors about the current status of their campaign by posting updates.

Tokens are awarded to donors at the end of each successful campaign. Also, a fee of 2% is paid to the creator of the contract(me of courseğŸ˜…).

## Features

- **Withdrawal**: Campaign owners can withdraw the funds once the campaign's goal is reached or a milestone is completed.
- **Refunds**: Donors can request refunds for their contributions before the campaign's refund deadline.
- **Token Distribution**: Successful campaigns will distribute a CrowdChain (CC) token to all donors proportional to their contributions.

## Project Structure

The CrowdChain project is divided into three main parts:

### Contracts

The contract folder contains the smart contracts for the CrowdChain platform. The main contracts are:

#### CampaignBase Contract

This is an abstract contract that provides the core functionality to create a campaign, withdraw from a campaign and request refunds.

#### Crowdfunding Contract

This contract extends the CampaignBase contract and adds the donation and refund functions.

#### CrowdfundingUpdates Contract

This contract extends the Crowdfunding contract and adds functionality to post and get updates.

#### CrowdchainToken Contract

This contract is an ERC20 token that is distributed to successful campaign donors.

### Client

The client folder contains the Next.js-based frontend application that allows users to interact with the CrowdChain platform.

### Server

The server folder contains the Express.js-based backend server responsible for handling the upload of campaign cover images to the IPFS network.

## Testing

The important functions in the smart contracts have been thoroughly tested using foundry.
